## Example Usage

### **Scenario 1: Unlocking the Door**
1. Open the mobile app on your Android device.
2. Navigate to the "Unlock Door" section.
3. Use your preferred method:
   - Fingerprint scan.
   - Voice command (e.g., "Unlock the door").
   - Mobile button press.
4. If authenticated, the door will unlock, and a success message will appear in the app.

### **Scenario 2: Breach Notification**
1. An unauthorized attempt is made to access the door.
2. The alarm system activates immediately.
3. A notification is sent to the user via:
   - Mobile app.
   - Email alert with details of the breach.

### **Scenario 3: Monitoring Lock Status**
1. Open the mobile app and navigate to the "Lock Status" section.
2. View the current status (Locked/Unlocked).
3. Check the activity log for recent actions.
